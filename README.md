This notebook demonstrates the steps for creating a machine learning model using Python's Sklearn library. It includes data preparation, feature selection, and model training, followed by evaluation of the model's performance. The code applies techniques to clean and transform the data, ensuring itâ€™s suitable for training. After processing, a model is selected, trained, and assessed for accuracy and generalization. This process illustrates best practices in machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to final model evaluation.
